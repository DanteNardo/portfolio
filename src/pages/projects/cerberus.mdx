# Cerberus
Cerberus is a serverless microservice that polls a list of RSS/ATOM feeds for new entries and posts them to users via Discord. The code is hosted on Upstash and Deno Deploy. A CLI is used by an admin to manage the feed configuration.

## Architecture
The full source of the CLI and web server are hosted on GitHub. I created several C4 diagrams to describe the system and container level context for the microservice. The entire service is serverless and hosted for free due to a low polling rate.
