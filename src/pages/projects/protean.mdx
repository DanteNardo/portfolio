# Protean App

Protean is a free tool for sending messages and rolling dice with friends. I created it primarily for playing roleplaying games online.

## No sign up. No worries.

Many free web apps require authentication and impose storage limits, but I found that unwarranted for this project. Protean app has no authentication and no data is saved or cached. Rooms are transient and live as long as users are connected to them. When a new user joins, the server requests the current room's state from an existing user and sends it to the new user. Once every user leaves, the room and its data ceases to exist.
