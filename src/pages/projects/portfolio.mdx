# Portfolio

This website acts as my online web presence, work portfolio, and resume. With great SEO, accessibility, and performance, hiring managers can quickly find all of my projects and work experience.

## Interactive Resume

Clicking on any piece of my resume will take users to a detailed page on this site. And with supported browsers, I can navigate to the resume page and use browser print controls to create the PDF I use to apply for jobs. Any time I want to update my resume, I only need to update this site on GitHub and CI/CD takes care of the rest.
