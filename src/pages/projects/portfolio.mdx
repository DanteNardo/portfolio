# Portfolio

This website acts as my online web presence, work portfolio, and resume. With great SEO, accessibility, and performance, hiring managers can quickly find all of my projects and work experience.

## Interactive Resume

With supported browsers, I can navigate to the resume page and use the built-in print controls to create a PDF that I use to apply for jobs. Any time I want to update my resume, I only need to update this site on GitHub.

- Website built using <Badge>Astro</Badge> for maximum performance
- Interactive components built with <Badge>React</Badge> and <Badge>TypeScript</Badge>
- Pages made with <Badge>MDX</Badge> to support Markdown and <Badge>React</Badge> components
