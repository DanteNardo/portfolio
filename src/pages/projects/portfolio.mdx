# Portfolio
This website acts as my online web presence, work portfolio, and resume. With great SEO, accessibility, and performance, hiring managers can quickly find all of my projects and work experience.

## Interactive Resume
Clicking on any piece of my resume will take users to a detailed page on this site. And with supported browsers, I can navigate to the resume page and use browser print controls to create the PDF I use to apply for jobs. Any time I want to update my resume, I only need to update this site on GitHub and CI/CD takes care of the rest.

## Perfect Score
PageSpeed Insights is a tool provided by Google to measure your website's performance, accessibility, and SEO. My portfolio scores a perfect score on every single page, even with animations, high resolution images, and client-side canvas graphics.
