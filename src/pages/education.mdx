## B.S. Game Design and Development

At the age of fourteen, I decided to teach myself C++ from a book. I've met many engineers with similar stories, but most note how what they really enjoy is solving problems. This was never the case for me. I wanted to make games, or more accurately, I wanted to make digital experiences. I wanted to design software that someone could use to express themselves or explore digital realms with.

Neri Oxman, an MIT professor and material ecologist, once said:

> Art is for expression, science is for exploration, engineering is for invention, and design is for communication

This concept is core to all of my work. College provided me with design and engineering training to improve my invention and communication skills. I use these every day as an engineer to create software solutions for artists and explorers.
