# Flow Library
I implemented the Flow library to provide Biosero developers with a tool to represent their desktop visual programs in a web environment. I programmed the user interface, the resizing/collapsing behaviors, and the dynamic layout engine.

## Program Visualization
Biosero's legacy desktop software acts as a visual programming tool for scientists. I was charged with creating a web version for our new cloud platform. The framework itself is agnostic to business logic and is only concerned with rendering linked blocks of content. The developer has to map a model to a visual component at runtime to display their data correctly. But no matter the size of the generated UI element, the engine will properly layout a readable visual program.
