# Viasat Outage Predictions
At Viasat, I worked on a web application to predict in-flight Wi-Fi outages and degraded quality based on a flightplan. This allowed customers to plan virtual meetings in advance and also predict when they would be unable to stream Netflix.

## Computational Geometry
In order to detect outages, I implemented a computational geometry library capable of merging polygons and tracking intersections between a polygon and a line. Outages occur when a plane enters a region with no coverage or when it enters a different satellite beam. The algorithm I developed using this library efficiently calculated the outages for any line drawn across a world map with many satellite beams, like the one below.
