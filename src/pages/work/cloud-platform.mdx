# Cloud Platform
When I joined Biosero I was the only full-time engineer working on their new cloud platform. This SAAS platform allows employees and customers to manage subscriptions, track licenses, and access software packages. It also serves as a base for all future cloud apps for the entire organization.

## Package Manager
Implemented Package Manager application to provide Biotech customers with our proprietary software and thousands of drivers to integrate it with their hardware. Customers and team members can easily track each version, its metadata, and even attach supporting files such as `README.txt` files.
